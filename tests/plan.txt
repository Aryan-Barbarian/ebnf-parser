Have a few different testing plans:

1. Unit tests on terms (plan_terms.txt)
2. Unit tests on loading (IO, escape chars) 
3. Unit tests on metaparsing (reading match strings, creating parsers)
4. End-to-end tests 
	4.1 Digits
	4.2 EBNF itself

Many tests won't be implemented because of low risk (e.g. repeat term metaparsing with every different type of term inside the repeat term)

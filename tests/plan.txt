Have a few different testing plans:

1. Unit tests on terms (plan_terms.txt)
2. Unit tests on rules 
3. Unit tests on parsers (IO, reading match strings)

Also, many tests won't be implemented because of low risk (e.g. repeat term metaparsing with every different type of term inside the repeat term)

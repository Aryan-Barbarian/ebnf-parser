# Text Part
1. Match starts (not important enough to be tested)
	1.1 at the beggining of text
	1.2 in the middle of text
	1.3 at the end of text (meaning the last char of the match is the last char of text)
2. The length of the match string
	2.1 is less than the length of text (make different than 1.*)
	2.2 is equal to length of text (make different than 1.*)
	2.3 is greater than length of text
	2.4 is zero (??)
3. Number of differences
	3.1 is 0 (tested above)
	3.2 is 1
	3.3 is all the characters
4. The mismatch is located at
	4.1 the begginig of the match string
	4.2 the middle of the match string
	4.3 the end of the match string



# Repeat Term
1. The inner term is
	1.1 a text term
	1.2 a repeat term (allowed??)
	1.3 a multiterm (expand on this with different patterns of matching)
	1.4 a variable
	1.5 empty (?)
2. The length of the match is
	2.1 less than text (impossible / useless)
	2.2 equal to text
		2.2.1 with 1 repeat
		2.2.2 with multiple repeats (greedy)
3. The pattern repeats
	3.1 0 times
	3.2 1 time
	3.3 more than once



# Variable Term
1. This variable name is
	1.1 defined
	1.2 undefined
2. This variable
	2.1 matches
	2.2 does not match



# Multiterm
1. The number of options
	1.1 is 1
	1.2 is more than one
2. The matched option is
	2.1 neither
	2.2 the first
	2.3 many options
	2.4 all options
3. The matched option's index is (probably tested in 2.3)
	3.1 the first 
	3.2 in the middle
	3.3 in the end
